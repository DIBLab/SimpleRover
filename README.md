# Experimentory Rover


This starter code is for The Wheeler School DIB Lab Summer Program 2017. Students are creating a line 
following robot.

Example of a line following robot: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQmdRzyuT-o

Students will be using a rover kit from Adafruit as their basis with a TB6612 dual h-bridge from Sparkfun to run the motors.

See TB6612Connection.png for a picture of the hook-up for this project.

Two photoresistors will track the robot's location compared to a line.
